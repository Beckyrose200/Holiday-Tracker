  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using this website</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The Register your Waste exemptions service is run by the Environment Agency.
    We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For
    example, that means you should be able to:
  </p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
    <li>zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
    <li>
      listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most
      recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">We have also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

    advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

    <li>we link to some PDF documents that are not fully accessible to screen reader software.</li>
    <li>browsers cannot automatically suggest information to help a user fill in a form.</li>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about this websiteâ€™s accessibility</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The Environment Agency is committed to making its website accessible, in
    accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications)
    (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    This service is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility
    Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed.
  </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>1.   Some pages use hint text that is not programmatically determined. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Disproportionate burden</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    We believe that fixing the accessibility problems with some content would be disproportionate because the relevant platform will be retired soon.
  </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we tested this website</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">The service was last tested on 4 March 2021 and was checked for compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    It was tested by the Waste exemptions development team, and the
    non-compliant elements will be included in the ongoing development work.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body-s">This statement was prepared on 17 Feb 2022.</p>
